<ul>
<li>6 ounces 170 grams Korean potato starch noodles (dangmyeon, 당면)</li>
<li>1 small carrot</li>
<li>1 small sweet onion</li>
<li>2 scallions</li>
<li>4 ounces 110 grams lean beef (sirloin or rib eye)</li>
<li>4 - 5 dried shiitake mushrooms soaked until plump - see note</li>
<li>6 ounces 170 grams fresh spinach</li>
<li>vegetable oil for stir frying</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>Japchae noodles</li>
</div>

<div class="c"> Sauce: </div>

<div class="d">
<ul>
<li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
<li>2 1/2 tablespoons sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
<li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
<li>2 teaspoons roasted sesame seeds</li>
<li>Egg garnish jidan - optional</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="e"> Instructions: </div>


<div class="f">
<ol>
<li>Combine all sauce ingredients in a small bowl and mix well until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
<li>Cut the carrot into match sticks. Thinly slice the onion. Cut the scallions into similar lengths.</li>
<li>Cut the beef into thin 2-inch long strips and mix with 1 tablespoon of the sauce. Cut the stems off the mushrooms, and slice into 1/4-inch thin strips. Season with 1 tablespoon of the sauce.</li>
<li>Blanch the spinach in boiling water only until wilted. Drain quickly and shock in cold water. Squeeze out excess water, cut into about 2-inch lengths, and lightly season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Bring a pot of water to a boil, and cook the noodles according to the package directions (usually 6 - 7 minutes). Rinse in cold water and drain. Cut the noodles with kitchen shears or a knife into 6 -7 inch lengths. Mix in 2 tablespoons of the prepared sauce in a large bowl.</li>
<li>In a large non-stick skillet, stir fry the noodles over medium heat, stirring frequently, until translucent and a bit sticky (about 4 minutes). Transfer back to the bowl.</li>
<li>Add 1/2 tablespoon of oil to the pan, and stir fry the onion until translucent over medium high heat, lightly sprinkling with salt and pepper. When the onion is almost done, stir-in the scallion and cook briefly. Transfer to the bowl with the noodles. Stir fry the carrot for 1 to 2 minutes until softened. (Do not overcook. The vegetables should be crisp.) Transfer to the bowl.</li>
<li>Stir fry the beef and mushrooms together until the meat is cooked through, 2 - 3 minutes. Transfer to the bowl.</li>
<li>Add the spinach and the remaining sauce to the bowl with all other prepared ingredients.</li>
<li>Toss well by hand. Adjust the seasoning to taste by adding a little more (start with 1/2 teaspoon) soy sauce and/or sugar as necessary.</li>
</ol>

<div class="g"> Recipe Notes: </div>


<div class="h">
<ul>
<li>Dried shiitake is ideal for its concentrated flavor and meatier texture, but you can use any kind of fresh/dried mushrooms such as oyster or button mushrooms. </li>
<li>Leftover japchae should be kept refrigerated. Japchae reheats well in the microwave. The noodles will get soft and chewy again. </li>
